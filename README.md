# Module-8

# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
Adopting a modular coding approach greatly enhances maintainability and readability by structuring the code into distinct files, each dedicated to a specific class or functional component. Each file should contain the relevant class along with its getter and setter methods, promoting clarity and ease of navigation. The main execution logic can reside in its own file, while helper functions can be organized into libraries. This systematic organization ensures that any adjustments made to a library automatically benefit all code that imports it, reducing redundancy and minimizing errors. Ultimately, this approach streamlines coding, facilitates easier debugging, and leads to a more robust and maintainable codebase that can adapt to evolving project requirements.



# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
I find it crucial to start the development process with a clear understanding of project requirements. By using a top-down, requirements-driven approach, I can establish the overall architecture before diving into individual components. This practice minimizes the risk of extensive rework, which often occurs with a bottom-up approach, such as needing to adjust function parameters or return types as the project evolves. A well-defined plan ensures that all components align with the overall goals, promoting a more efficient development process.



# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists regularly face challenges that require analysis and innovative solutions. They identify these challenges, interpret their causes, and rigorously test their solutions, which is vital for creating high-quality, user-friendly software that meets client needs. Engaging with these challenges fosters professional growth and develops problem-solving skills. Moreover, adopting a modular design allows for the creation of self-contained components that can be easily updated or repurposed. This flexibility streamlines future development and reduces costs, making it an efficient strategy for companies like Grazioso Salvare. By utilizing this approach, organizations can enhance their efficiency and adaptability in a rapidly changing technological landscape.
